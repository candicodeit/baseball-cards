					<h1>Baseball card history</h1>

				<p>Like the game itself, baseball cards evolved from a simple hobby for kids to big business.</p>
	
				<p>How big? Just a few years ago, a Honus Wagner card, the rarest of rare finds, sold for nearly $3 million - about the annual salary of a lower-level free agent today.</p>
				<p>Despite that recent record sale, baseball cards peaked as an investment more than 15 years ago. Collectors still buy, sell and trade. Fans still wait outside the visiting team's hotel to get their cards and other collectibles signed, but not to pre-1994 baseball strike levels.</p>
				<p>Even so, baseball cards represent a slice of Americana that reflects not only the game's popularity, but changes in technology that allowed cards to be mass produced and more attractive.</p> 
				
				<p>No one was genius enough to say, hey, let's put images of baseball heroes on tiny cardboard rectangles and sell them. The earliest cards were essentially a marketing gimmick that captured the imagination and brought fans closer to the game.</p> 
				
				<p>In the late 1860s, the Peck and Snyder sporting goods company began producing and handing out flyer-like cards that featured the picture of a baseball team or player posing formally or in action on one side and an advertisement for their products on the other.</p>  
				
				<p>By the mid-1880s, as interest in the game grew, tobacco companies had picked up on the idea, inserting baseball cards to boost sales, but also to protect and keep their cigarette packs stiff. Smokers bought the packs and usually handed the cards, which were much smaller then, over to their kids.</p> 
				
				<p>Before the turn of the century, the tobacco companies merged. Without competition, baseball cards were no longer needed as a marketing edge.That void didn't last long, though. When the federal government broke up the tobacco monopoly, baseball cards returned. And not just in cigarette packs and tobacco pouches, but in gum and candy, games, loaves of bread, even clothes and meat - anything to encourage a sale.</p> 
				
				<p>By 1910, as the game grew into the national pastime, almost 75 different series of cards were in circulation. The various styles, sizes and production quality had created a secondary market for fans and collectors.</p> 
				
				<p>The Library of Congress maintains one of the oldest and most complete sets of baseball cards, a donated collection of 2,100 cards from 1887 to 1914, featuring such all-time greats as Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker and Cy Young.</p> 
				
				<p>With the country mired in World War I, tobacco companies got out of the card business for good. But by then, the appeal for baseball fans was clear. Gum and candy companies filled the gap. And from the early 1950s on, the Topps Chewing Gum Co. has been the dominant producer of baseball cards.</p> 
				
				<p>Topps originally began producing baseball cards to sell more gum. Eventually, the powdery pink stick of bubble gum became the throw-in for a pack of cards instead of the other way around. The cards were the main attraction.</p> 
				
				<p>For baseball fans, cards became a kind of handy guide to learn about the players and managers. Cards with a player's statistics on the back were made in the early 1900s. But that concept really took off in the 1950s, when Topps dominated the market with better, more colorful photography and comprehensive player stats and biographical information on the back. If a fan wanted to research players, baseball cards were the best way to do it.</p> 
				
				<p>The baseball card market as an investment peaked in the late 1980s to early 1990s, driven, as some baseball historians argue, by a flood of competition and baby boomers with money to spend. Companies such as Fleer, Score and Upper Deck were going head to head with Topps as demand and values soared. Interest spurred baseball card conventions, the publication of card valuation guides and the need for professional authenticators.</p> 
				
				<p>Before the 1994 baseball strike, collecting as an investment was so popular there were 25,000 to 30,000 card stores around the country. Now, there are maybe 1,500, according to long-time hobbyist Rich Klein, of the Society for American Baseball Research. When card-makers flooded the market, the hobby crashed.</p> 
				
				<p>While down from its peak, the buying, trading and selling continues. And rare cards of popular players can still bust the value barrier. In 2007, an immaculate Honus Wagner card from 1909-11 reportedly sold for a record price of more than $2.8 million.</p> 
				
				<p>Only about 60 of the cards were made because Wagner ordered production stopped. Folklore has it that Wagner didn't want his image associated with tobacco. The truth, according to baseball historians, is he didn't feel he was getting paid enough for having his face on a card. Baseball was all business even back then.</p> 
				
				<p>Most cardmakers compensated the players at least something to use their pictures, even in the early years of professional baseball. In fact, Klein said, money distributed by the Major League Baseball Players Association from baseball card licensing fees was so significant that it helped some players weather the '94 strike.</p>
