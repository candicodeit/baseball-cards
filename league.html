				<p>It’s been more than 140 years since the first professional baseball league was cobbled together, but the motivation behind the game hasn’t changed much.</p>
	
				<p>Post-Civil War baseball was an amateur’s game until pressure to win from sponsors who helped cover a team’s travel expenses led to the best “amateur” players being secretly paid. Which led to chucking the whole amateur charade and buying the best talent a team could afford - all for fun, profit and bragging rights.</p>
				
				<p>Sound familiar?</p>
				
				<p>In fact, baseball’s first “Evil Empire” wasn’t the late George Steinbrenner’s free-agency-raiding New York Yankees, but the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, stacked with players recruited from around the country by the promise of a paycheck. The payoff: They went 57-0.</p> 
				
				<p>To compete, all pretense of what had been an amateur’s game was dropped and professional baseball was born.</p> 
				
				<p>And, since 1903, the champion of Major League Baseball has been crowned in a World Series between the best team from the National and American leagues.</p>
				
				<p>By now, the “Fall Classic” is so ingrained in the American fabric that fans may not realize the World Series was essentially a business compromise between two competing professional baseball leagues.</p> 
				
				<p>How did baseball get to that point? Like most business ventures, professional baseball pre-1920, which set the foundation for today’s major leagues, was born of a series of stops and start-ups.</p> 
				
				<p>By 1871, baseball’s growing popularity - and the push to pay players - hatched the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, generally considered the first organized pro baseball league.</p> 
				
				<p>The National Association consisted of the dominant Cincinnati club and teams from Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, Troy, N.Y.,  Fort Wayne, Ind., Cleveland and Rockford, Ill. By 1875, the league had grown to 13 teams.</p> 
				
				<p>A year later, the name was changed to the National League, reflecting a more formal business approach. Businessmen, instead of players, owned and ran the clubs. The league also set standards for scheduling, tickets prices and how much players would be paid.</p> 
				
				<p>Eyeing the National League’s success, the rival American Association began play in 1882, luring fans with such innovations as Sunday games, beer sales and cheaper tickets. (Yes, you got that right. Beer.) The competing leagues also raided each other’s rosters before striking a deal to lay off. The agreement also prevented players from jumping leagues.</p> 
				
				<p>But the player restrictions prompted upstarts.</p> 
				
				<p>In 1884, players who sought the freedom of their own league formed the Union Association. It lasted one season.</p>  
				
				<p>And, in 1890, a similar Players League debuted, filling its rosters with top players from the National League and American Association.</p> 
				
				<p>The Players League went bust after one season as well, but had irreparably crippled the American Association by stealing talent and undercutting ticket prices. Several AA teams bolted for the NL before the association eventually folded.</p> 
				
				<p>When the dust settled, the lone survivor was the National League, a 12-team professional baseball monopoly. A business with no competition. All should have been right with the world.</p> 
				
				<p>It wasn’t.</p> 
				
				<p>Before the turn of the century, the National League was financially limping along. Competitive balance was a wreck. (Kinda like it is today.) The same handful of teams dominated every season. The rest floundered. Attendance suffered.</p>    
				
				<p>To save the league, the owners dropped teams in Baltimore, Cleveland, Louisville and Washington. The NL continued with its sturdier clubs: the Boston Beaneaters, Brooklyn Superbas, Chicago Orphans, Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Perfectos.</p> 
				
				<p>One league’s failure was another’s opportunity.</p> 
				
				<p>The Western League, one of many minor leagues in the late 1800s, renamed itself the American League, declared itself a Major League and added teams in Baltimore, Cleveland and Washington – three of the four cities the NL had dropped.</p>
				
				<p>The fledgling American League also went head to head with the competition by putting teams in the National League cities of Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. In 1901, the original eight-team AL also had clubs in Detroit and Milwaukee and raided many of the NL’s best players.</p>
				
				<p>By 1903, the National and American leagues, each with eight teams, agreed to co-exist and have their champions compete in a World Series.</p>
				
				<p>The two leagues also teamed up to squelch a third.</p>
				<p>In 1914, the rival Federal League debuted with teams and new ballparks in Baltimore, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Pittsburgh and St. Louis.</p> 
				
				<p>Operators of the new league filed an antitrust suit, contending the American and National leagues maintained an unfair monopoly. But the new league folded after just two seasons as the case languished in federal court.</p> 
				
				<p>The presiding judge: Kennesaw Landis, who later became commissioner of baseball.</p>
