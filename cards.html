			<article class="anson">
				<span>Adrian Constantine "Cap" Anson</span>
				<span>(1852-1922)</span>
				<p>Dubbed "Pop" or "Cap" for captain, Anson is widely considered among the greatest hitters or greatest player-managers of the 19th century. Played 27 years in the Major Leagues, mainly at first base with Chicago of the National League. Had a career batting average of .339, topping .400 twice. As Chicago's player-manager, Anson led his team to more than 1,200 wins and five National League pennants. Was among the first managers to take his club south for preseason conditioning, a precursor to the traditional spring training. Anson was also a racist who did all he could to extend baseball's ban on black players.</p>

				<span>John Franklin "Home Run" Baker</span>
				<span>(1886-1963)</span>
				<p>Today, a ballplayer with Baker's power numbers (96 career homers in 15 seasons) would be nicknamed "Home Run" in jest. But during the game's so-called "Dead Ball" era, in which slap hitters were the norm, the third baseman for the Philadelphia Athletics and New York Yankees was the game's feared long-ball threat. Baker led the American League in homers from 1911-14, with no more than 12 in a season. The .307 lifetime hitter destroyed pitchers when it mattered most: In 25 World Series games, he batted .363, hit three homers and drove in 18 runs, leading manager Connie Mack's Philadelphia A's to three World Series crowns.</p>

				<span>Charles Albert "Chief" Bender</span>
				<span>(1884-1954)</span>
				<p>Imagine the dugout catcalls the Chippewa Indian had to deflect while on the mound. But Bender overcame an insulting nickname to become one of the dominant hurlers of his time, going 212-127 with a 2.77 ERA in 16 seasons, all but four of them with the Philadelphia Athletics. Bender, who won 180 games before turning 30, is credited with inventing what was then called the "nickel curve," now known as the slider. He's also the first pitcher to throw three complete games in a six-game World Series. He graduated from the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, the first federally-run, off-reservation boarding school for Native American children.</p>

				<span>Roger Philip Bresnahan</span>
				<span>(1879-1944)</span>
				<p>Irish brawlers dominated the rosters of baseball's early years, but none was more obstinate than Roger Bresnahan, a pain in the butt to umpires, opponents, teammates he felt weren't giving their best, and even some team owners. Bresnahan played for six teams - and all nine positions for a few of them - in 17 seasons. He hit a modest .279, but was considered one of the most effective leaders and top defensive catchers of his time. Bresnahan, who was the rare catcher fast enough to bat lead-off, was also an innovator. He introduced an early version of the shin-guard and the protective helmet.</p>

				<span>Brooklyn Dodgers</span>
				<span>1913</span>
				<p>On paper, the season was unremarkable - 65-84, good for sixth place in the National League. But in baseball history, few teams spun such folklore, caused such heartbreak and shared such a love affair with their fans as the Dodgers. And it all began in 1913. Technically, Brooklyn already had a baseball team. But that was the year the club shortened its name from Trolley Dodgers and moved into Ebbets Field was born, replacing the old, wooden Washington Park. The site included a former garbage dump known as "Pigtown" because pigs ate there. Ebbets Field cost $750,000 and opened with a capacity of 32,000. Estimated value of Dodger memories made there: priceless.</p>

			<article class="brown">
				<span>Mordecai Peter Centennial "Three Finger" Brown</span>
				<span>(1876-1948)</span>
				<p>A farm machinery accident as a boy turned Brown's right index finger into a nub. Somehow, he turned tragedy into an advantage on the mound. "The accident gave me a firmer grip on the ball, so I could spin it over the hump," he explained. "It gave me a greater dip." Brown, called "Three Finger" because of his mangled hand, dipped his way to 239 victories, including six 20-win seasons, and a winning percentage of .648. He led the Chicago Cubs to four National League pennants and two World Series titles, and was the first major leaguer to toss four straight shutouts.</p>

			<article class="chance">
				<span>Frank Leroy Chance</span>
				<span>(1877-1924)</span>
				<p>His putouts were where baseball rallies came to die. "Tinkers to Evers to Chance" was immortalized in a 1910 poem about the game's most famous double-play combination. But Chance, who anchored first base for the Chicago Cubs for 15 years, was much more than the receiving end of a middle-infield ballet. He was 27 when he became Chicago's player-manager in mid-1905, leading the Cubs to four pennants in five years, including the last World Series crown in franchise history (1908). In 1906, he managed the Cubs to 116 wins, still a Major League best. He was also the first player tossed from a World Series game.</p>

				<span>(1884-1969)</span>
				<p>Cicotte was one of baseball's top pitchers, winning 208 and losing 149 games in 14 seasons. But all of that was wiped out when he and seven Chicago White Sox teammates (including outfielder "Shoeless" Joe Jackson) were banned from baseball for life for fixing the 1919 World Series, known as the Black Sox scandal. Cicotte, a starting pitcher with a mean knuckleball, pitched three games of the series, winning one and losing two as the favored White Sox lost to Cincinnati in eight games.</p>

			<article class="cobb">
				<span>Tyrus Raymond "Ty" Cobb</span>
				<span>(1886-1961)</span>
				<p>Cobb remains one of baseball's greatest players, especially at the plate. The "Georgia Peach" still owns the highest lifetime batting average of all time (.366), hitting over .300 for 23 straight seasons, including three times topping .400. Cobb, who spent all but two of his 24 seasons with the Detroit Tigers, won 12 batting titles, including nine straight. Perhaps the major league's most intimidating player, Cobb was notorious for his spikes-high slides and aggressive play. He stole nearly 900 bases, including 54 steals of home, an all-time record. Cobb may have been baseball's first $1 million man - not by salary, but by investing in real estate, stocks and a company called Coca-Cola.</p>

			<article class="collins">
				<span>Edward Trowbridge "Eddie" Collins</span>
				<span>(1887-1951)</span>
				<p>Collins, in his 25 seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics and Chicago White Sox, was one of the scrappiest second basemen to ever play the game. He perfected a punch-hitting style at the plate by choking up on the bat handle for better control. The result: Collins batted .333 all time, with 3,315 hits. He struck out just 286 times in nearly 10,000 at-bats. He's the only American League player to steal six bases in one game, achieving that twice in less than two weeks in 1912.</p>

				<span>(1859-1931)</span>
				<p>Comiskey was a true pioneer of the game, a participant for nearly 50 years at every level - player, manager, owner. He became player-manager of the American Association's St. Louis Browns at age 24. As a first baseman, he is credited with being the first player to play off and behind the bag, increasing his range in the field. He was a founder of the American League in 1901 and owned the Chicago White Sox for 31 years, winning five pennants and two World Series. In 1910, he built Comiskey Park, but his legacy is tarnished by the 1919 Black Sox scandal in which eight of his players were banned from baseball for throwing the World Series.</p>

				<span>Edward James "Ed" Delahanty</span>
				<span>(1867-1903)</span>
				<p>Delahanty was one of baseball's top hitters of the 1890s, playing mainly for the Philadelphia Phillies. In an era of punch hitters, "Big Ed" or "Del," as he was called, once slammed four homers in a game in 1896, twice went 6-for-6 and batted 9-for-9 in a doubleheader. He finished with a career mark of .346, fourth best all-time. But the left fielder's short life ended tragically. His body was discovered floating at the base of Niagara Falls by an operator of the Maid of the Mist tour boat.</p>

				<p>Evers manned second based for the Chicago Cubs' legendary double-play combination, Tinkers to Evers to Chance. Known as "the Crab" for the way he slid around the infield to smother grounders, Evers was a clutch-hitting Derek Jeter of his day, driving in the winning run in the 1907 and 1908 World Series as the Cubs won four National League pennants in five years. Despite their magic in the field, Evers and shortstop Joe Tinker often battled in the clubhouse and didn't speak to each other for years.</p>

				<p>Huggins played second base for 13 seasons with Cincinnati and St. Louis, doubling as player-manager with the Cardinals. But the 5-6 Huggins, known as the "Mighty Mite'' for his size and feisty temperament, is best remembered as one of baseball's greatest managers. He skippered the Yankees to six pennants and three World Series titles, the first in Yankees' history. His 1927 "Murderer's Row" team, with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, is widely considered the greatest of all time.</p>

				<span>(1887-1946)</span>
				<p>Nicknamed the "Big Train" by sportswriter Grantland Rice for his size and 99 mile-per-hour fastball, Johnson started an incredible 666 games and came on in relief an estimated 150 times for the Washington Senators. By the time a broken leg ended his 21-year pitching career, Johnson had chalked up 416 wins and 3,508 strikeouts, with an ERA of 2.17. Hallmarks were a run of 16 straight wins in 1912, and a string of 56 scoreless innings with a 36-7 record and ERA of 1.09 in 1913. As dominant as Johnson was on the mound, one opposing pitcher owned him: Babe Ruth, who won six of their eight duels when the slugger pitched for the Boston Red Sox.</p>

				<span>(1880-1911)</span>
				<p>Baseball's most underrated pitcher? How about Joss, an ace who died too young. Otherwise, his numbers would have be among the all-time best. As it is, Joss, who never had a losing season, completed an incredible 234 of his 260 starts for Cleveland. He recorded an ERA of 1.83 or lower five times (one of every four starts was a shutout) and won at least 20 games four seasons in a row, including a career-high 27 in 1907. He pitched a perfect game in 1908 and a no-hitter two years later. But Joss died at age 30 from tubercular meningitis just before the 1911 season opened.</p>

				<span>(1872-1923)</span>
				<p>The "size of the fight in the dog" motto could have described Keeler, although the diminutive rightfielder had his own: "Hit 'em where they ain't." And he did, with at least 200 hits in eight straight seasons, two batting titles and a 44-game hitting streak in 1897. Just 5-4 and 140 pounds, but with speed and a sharp batter's eye he punched his way to 13 straight seasons of .300 or better and a .345 career average. With Keeler, it was also not about the size of the lumber in the fight, but the size of the fight in the lumber. His bat was just 30 inches long and weighed only 29 ounces, among the smallest ever.</p>

				<span>(1857-1894)</span>
				<p>Before Babe Ruth became the toast of baseball, there was Kelly, the game's chief drawing card of the late 19th century. The catcher-outfielder led the Chicago White Stockings to five National League titles in seven years, but it was his innovation, daring on the base paths and Irish charm that made him the game's first real superstar. He, with teammate Cap Anson, is credited with devising the hit-and-run, the double steal, the hook slide, adjusting fielders for each hitter's tendencies, playing off first and third base for better range and having the catcher back up first base on grounders. He was the first player to sign autographs and to publish an autobiography. The "King of Baseball" was so popular that he prompted a hit song and became a vaudeville star himself.</p>

				<p>One of the game's greatest second-basemen, Lajoie batted over .300 in 16 of 21 seasons, including 10 times over .350 and .338 for his career. But it was his jump from the National League's Philadelphia Phillies to Connie Mack's rival Philadelphia Athletics in 1901 that gave the fledgling American League instant credibility. He led the AL in fielding and almost every hitting category and set a league single-season batting average record of .426 that still stands. Lajoie, the first player to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded, battled Ty Cobb for the battling title in 1909. On the season's final day, Lajoie went 8 for 8, but fell .0007 short.</p>

Mack was offered the job to manage and own 25 percent of the American League's new Philadelphia Athletics in 1901. He built not one dynasty, but two, winning five World Series crowns, including four pennants in five years from 1901-14, and three straight from 1929-31. As manager, he wore a suit and tie in the dugout, meaning he couldn't step onto the field. Instead, he waved his scorecard to position his fielders. When John McGraw called Mack's A's a white elephant, he made it his team's mascot, which the Oakland A's still use.</p>

But Marquard earned every penny, winning 73 games from 1911-13 24-, 26- and 23-win seasons to lead the Giants to three straight pennants. The 1912 season was especially magical. He won 19 straight, a string that lasted from opening day to July 3, resulting in instant celebrity. The feat spurred a part in the film, "19 Straight," and led to a co-headlining role with his future wife Blossom Seeley in the vaudeville skit, "Breaking the Record".</p>

He led the league in strikeouts and wins four times and in ERA five times, confounding hitters with what he called a "fadeaway pitch," now known as the screwball. All but one of his 17 major league seasons were with the New York Giants, who he led to four World Series appearances. Mathewson's lone world championship came in 1905 when he dominated Philadelphia by tossing three shutouts in six days. Mathewson won 373 games, tied third all-time. His 37-win season of 1908 remains a modern NL record.</p>

In 31 years directing the New York Giants, they won 10 pennants, finished second 11 times and won three World Series. McGraw is second all-time with 2,840 wins. He came out of retirement to manage the National League in the first All-Star game in 1933. Playing mainly as a third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles of the 1890s, McGraw is credited with such innovations as the hit-and-run, Baltimore chop and squeeze play.

Plank, who completed all 41 games he started in 1905, won at least 20 games eight times.

				<span>(1862-1935)</span>
				<p>Chicago White Sox outfielder Sunday was a base-stealing phenom who was clocked circling the bases in just 14 seconds. But for Sunday, who was raised in an orphanage, baseball wasn't his calling. Serving the Lord was. After seven years in the major leagues, Sunday quit and became a world-famous evangelist, preaching to more than 100 million people in his lifetime. </p>

				<span>(1880-1948)</span>
				<p>Baseball's fabled double-play combination, Tinker to Evers to Chance, almost never happened. Tinker preferred third base, but reluctantly moved to shortstop during spring training before the 1902 season. The result: A Chicago Cubs defense that ranks among the greatest of the "Dead Ball" era. He was a aggressive and clutch in big games. Tinker led National League shortstops in fielding five times and the Cubs to four pennants.</p>

				<span>(1874-1914)</span>
				<p>On the mound, lefty Waddell dazzled hitters with a fastball, curve and excellent command. Off the field, he was a bit out of control, wrestling alligators and hitting the booze on road trips to the point that Sporting News referred to him as the "sousepaw." But he could pitch. He had four 20-plus win seasons in a row 1902-05 for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, led the AL in strikeouts six straight seasons and set a record at the time with strikeouts in a game (16) and for a season (349). Waddell was the first hurler to strike out the side on nine pitches.</p>

				<span>(1888-1972)</span>
				<p>Wheat, who anchored left field for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1909-26, was a hitting machine. Wheat, named for U.S. President Zachary Taylor and Jefferson Davis, batted over .300 14 times. He won the 1918 batting title with a .335 average and finished third in the NL MVP voting after hitting a career-best .375 - at the age of 36. Wheat still holds the Dodgers record for most games, at-bats and hits. In the off-season, Wheat raised mules on his Missouri farm, some of which were sold to the U.S. Army during World War I.</p>

				<span>Howard Ellsworth "Smoky Joe" Wood</span>
				<span>(1889-1985)</span>
				<p>Wood reinvented himself. The right-hander went 34-5 with 10 shutouts and 16 straight wins in 1912, adding three more victories in the World Series to lead the Boston Red Sox to a championship. It was one of the most dominant seasons a pitcher has ever had. But an arm injury forced an early retirement until Wood returned as a hard-hitting outfielder with Cleveland. After the major leagues, Wood went on to a successful coaching career at Yale.</p>

				<span>Denton True "Cy" Young</span>
				<span>(1867-1955)</span>
				<p>A century since  his last pitch, he remains the best who ever lived. Young won 511 games, almost 100 more than any other pitcher. During his 23-year career, spent mainly in Cleveland and Boston, Young won 30 games in a season five times and topped 20 wins 15 times. He threw the first pitch in a modern-day World Series, tossed the first perfect game one of his three no-hitters, hurled and won complete games of a double-header and once pitched 23 straight hitless innings over four games. By the time he was through, Young recorded more wins, innings pitched, starts and complete games than anyone, records that still stand.</p>
